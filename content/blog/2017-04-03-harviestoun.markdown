## Website

## Technology

Ruby on Rails, PostgreSQL, jQuery, SCSS

## My involvement

Harviestoun were an existing client of Primate but their site was several years old and in need of a revamp so Primate were once again called upon to develop their site.

The content of the site was setup by myself to be managed through [Spree](https://spreecommerce.org/) but with considerable alterations to the front end shop than the normal Spree interface to integrate with the front end templates from our designers.

Payments were to be made through [Sage Pay](https://www.sagepay.co.uk/) which required me to build a custom API as there were no existing Spree/Sage Pay implementations.
