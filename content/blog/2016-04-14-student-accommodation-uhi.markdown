## Website

[https://studentaccommodationuhi.co.uk](https://studentaccommodationuhi.co.uk)

## Technology

Ruby on Rails, PostgreSQL, jQuery, SCSS

## My involvement

I built the admin system with Active Admin to allow staff to manage their locations and rooms as well as set the system up for English and Scottish Gaelic languages. I also built the booking system to allow students to provisionally book their accommodation. I built the majority of this Rails app from scratch and took the static front end designs from our designers and hooked them up to slim templates.
