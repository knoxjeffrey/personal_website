## Website

[https://www.etesting.com](https://www.etesting.com)

## Technology

Ruby on Rails, LocomotiveCMS, PostgreSQL, mongoDB, jQuery, SCSS

## My involvement

Although I had some front end involvement towards the end of the project, my main focus was on building the training part of the website that would allow e-testing to sell their training courses online with payments made through [Sage Pay](https://www.sagepay.co.uk/).

Courses, locations, course dates and more are managed by staff through an Active Admin backend interface. Careful attention was spent optimising the backend scopes to work with [Filterrific](http://filterrific.clearcove.ca/) for the front end filters on the training site.
