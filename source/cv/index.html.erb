<h2>Summary</h2>

<p>
  I'm a senior software engineer with over <%= ((Date.today - Date.new(2015, 8, 1))/365).floor %> years
  experience and currently work at <%= link_to "Stora", "https://stora.co/" %>. Prior to working with Stora,
  I was a senior software engineer in the Front End Architecture team at <%= link_to "FreeAgent", "https://www.freeagent.com/" %>
  and before that I was Head of Development at a digital agency called <%= link_to "Primate", "http://primate.co.uk/" %>.
</p>

<p>
  I've used my technical and problem solving skills not only to deliver complex web applications but also
  make improvements to web performance and build pipelines. Excellent communication skills have enabled me
  to work closely with sales, marketing and engineering teams.
</p>

<p> 
  I started my software engineering journey in 1998, studying for a degree in Computer and Management
  Science but, after finishing with a 2:1 Honours Degree, I had an opportunity to work with an exciting
  new medical device technology. I re-trained and ran my own clinic for 11 years and combined that with
  research work on a hand held medical device for improving spinal biomechanics.
</p>

<p> 
  I sold the clinic in February 2015 but had been getting the bug for programming again one year prior
  to this. I knew this was the direction I wanted to take my career and enrolled in a bootcamp
  specialising in Ruby and Ruby on Rails before finding freelance work and it's been upwards from there!

  <% card title: "Senior Software Engineer for FreeAgent" do %>
    Part of a small group of engineers setting up a new Front End Architecture team at FreeAgent. Our
    initial responsibility is to gradually port legacy JavaScript to a single, modern build pipeline.

    Our long term aim is to implement systems that improve the lives of the engineering teams working on 
    the FreeAgent front-end, making adding and maintaining features a breeze. These responsibilities will
    range from enabling teams to easily maintain npm package versions, keeping the build pipeline fast,
    ease of using reusable code patterns and much, much more.

  <%= alert text: "Apr 2019 - Mar 2021", type: :primary, html: { class: "margin-bottom--s" } %>
  <% card title: "Software Engineer for FreeAgent" do %>
    Joined the Marketing Platform team which has responsibility for the FreeAgent <%= link_to "marketing site", "https://www.freeagent.com/" %>
    as well as supporting multiple teams throughout the business.

    During my time, I helped setup the PageSpeed Insights API in our Data Warehouse to track the
    performance effects of changes in our code base. I added Perfume.js to the website which pushed Core
    Web Vitals measurements to our GA account for better oversight of Real User Metrics.

    I made significant improvements in deploy times and helped lead the project to move the static
    website from our self hosted infrastructure over to Netlify. This infrastructure enabled engineers to
    work closely with the Sales team to deliver personalised learning experiences for our accountancy
    practices and significantly increase engagement.
