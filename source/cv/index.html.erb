<h1>CV</h1>
<hr/>

<h2>Summary</h2>

<p>
  I've been a software engineer for over <%= ((Date.today - Date.new(2015, 8, 1))/365).floor %> years
  and currently work for <%= link_to "FreeAgent", "https://www.freeagent.com/" %>. This role has
  required a mix of technical and project management skills to collaborate with multiple departments
  and deliver projects on time which have driven new business to FreeAgent.
</p>

<p>
  Prior to working with FreeAgent I was Head of Development at
  <%= link_to "Primate", "http://primate.co.uk/" %> where I worked with dozens of companies to help
  them unlock their potential. Projects ranged from marketing sites, to applications interfacing with
  large CMS' and CRMs, to MVPs for startups and large scale organisations.
</p>

<p> 
  I started my software engineering journey in 1998, studying for a degree in Computer and Management
  Science but, after finishing with a 2:1 Honours Degree, I had an opportunity to work with an exciting
  new medical device technology. I re-trained and ran my own clinic for 11 years and combined that with
  research work on a hand held medical device for improving spinal biomechanics.
</p>

<p> 
  I sold the clinic in February 2015 but had been getting the bug for programming again one year prior
  to this. I knew this was the direction I wanted to take my career and enrolled in a bootcamp
  specialising in Ruby and Ruby on Rails before finding freelance work and finally working with Primate.

<h2>Career</h2>

<% timeline do %>
  <%= alert text: "Apr 2021 - Present", type: :primary, html: { class: "margin-bottom--s" } %>
  <% card title: "Senior Software Engineer for FreeAgent" do %>
    Part of a small group of engineers setting up a new Front End Architecture team at FreeAgent. Our
    initial responsibility is to document our existing legacy JavaScript throughout the application
    and gradually port everything to a single, modern build pipeline. We favour progressively enhancing
    the UI with JavaScript where needed and <%= link_to "ViewComponent", "https://viewcomponent.org/" %>
    and <%= link_to "Stimulus", "https://stimulus.hotwired.dev/" %> are integral to our Architecture
    strategy moving forward. Our long term aim is to implement systems to improve the lives of the
    engineering teams working on the FreeAgent front-end, making adding and maintaining features a breeze.
    These responsibilities will range from enabling teams to easily maintain npm package versions, keeping
    the build pipeline fast, ease of using reusable code patterns and much, much more.

  <%= alert text: "Apr 2019 - Mar 2021", type: :primary, html: { class: "margin-bottom--s" } %>
  <% card title: "Software Engineer for FreeAgent" do %>
    Joined the Marketing Platform team which has responsibility for the FreeAgent
    <%= link_to "marketing site", "https://www.freeagent.com/" %> as well as supporting multiple
    teams in the business. During my time I helped setup the PageSpeed Insights API in our Data Warehouse
    for daily tracking of desktop and mobile scores and setup dashboards in Looker to help track the
    effects of changes in our codebase. Additionally, I added Perfume.js to the website which pushed Core
    Web Vitals measurements to our GA account for better oversight of Real User Metrics. I also made 
    significant improvements in deploy times and helped lead the project to move the static website from
    our self hosted infrastructure over to Netlify. This infrastructure has enabled our team to  work
    closely with the Sales team to deliver personalised learning experiences for our accountancy
    practices by using Netlify functions to gate sections of the static site, login using their FreeAgent
    credentials and fetch data from Salesforce.
