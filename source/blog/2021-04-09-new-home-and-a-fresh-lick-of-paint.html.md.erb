My personal website had been a bit neglected lately. It was looking dated, the performance wasn't great and it was quickly built from a stock [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) template.

I've been developing a lot with [Middleman](https://middlemanapp.com/) at [my work](https://www.freeagent.com/) and feel like I know it inside out. Being productive is important for my personal site so I can easily make changes but also make it completely customisable. I love the simplicity of static site generators (SSG) for websites like this so Middleman was an easy choice.

Gone too is [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/), swapped out for [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/). It's so easy to spin up sites on Netlify, it's very customisable and I have plans to use Lambda functions for additional functionality. [Netlify Functions](https://www.netlify.com/products/functions/) makes this incredibly easy to develop and test which made Netlify very attractive.
