My personal website had been a bit neglected lately. It was looking dated, the performance wasn't great and it was quickly built from a stock [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) template.

I've been working a lot with [Middleman](https://middlemanapp.com/) at my work and feel like I know it inside out. Being productive is important for my personal site so I can easily make changes but also make it completely customisable. I love the simplicity of static sites for site like this so Middleman was an easy choice to use as my SSG.
