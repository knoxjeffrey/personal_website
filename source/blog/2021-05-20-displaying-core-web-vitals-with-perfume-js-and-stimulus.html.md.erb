[Core Web Vitals](https://web.dev/vitals/) are all the rage right now because of effect they might have on search rankings. I'm passionate about website performance and thought it might be nice to make more of a feature of Core Web Vitals on my personal site.

At my work we've been capturing Core Web Vitals for some time now with the help of Perfume.js and I wanted to use the tool on this site. I have bigger plans for this captured data to be used in a proof of concept dashboard in a future project but that can wait for now!

In this blog post I want to walk you through how I implemented the `Core Web Vitals for this visit` button that you might be able to see at the bottom of this page. Not on a Chromium browser? Then this button will be hidden because Firefox and Safari for example do not currently support the necessary APIs to track the metrics. Sorry!

On this website I use Stimulus which is a modest JavaScript framework designed to enhance my static HTML. The easiest way to work through the code is probably to show the final Stimulus controller code as well as a stripped down version of the HTML and then explain the process bit by bit.
