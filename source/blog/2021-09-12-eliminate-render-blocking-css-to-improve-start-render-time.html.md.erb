This website scores a perfect 100 in [PageSpeed Insights](https://developers.google.com/speed/pagespeed/insights) but that doesn't mean things can't be improved. First time visitors on slower connections used to see nothing for over 1.6s before finally seeing a fully rendered view. I'd like to explain how I rendered the view more progressively with inline and async CSS to improve start render time by 0.5s.
