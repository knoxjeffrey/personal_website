I've started using [Perfume.js](https://zizzamia.github.io/perfume/) on this site to capture web performance metrics including [Core Web Vitals](https://web.dev/vitals/). As part of this, I wanted to create a flexible logging tool that would help me send this data to my [Supabase](https://supabase.io/) backend but also handle logging any other performance data in the future, and heck, handle anything I might want to log!

My solution is inspired by the idea of a dataLayer as used with Google Tag Manager. It's an array (with some additional functionality in my case) that can have objects with an event name pushed to it from anywhere in the front-end. Those event objects can then be handled on an individual basis, such as forwarding on performance events to supabase in this case. I'm calling my creation pushr!
