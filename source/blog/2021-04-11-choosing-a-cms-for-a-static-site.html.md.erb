To encourage myself to create more content on my personal site I thought it would be helpful to have a better writing environment. I wanted something that was simple to setup, ideally free, and would offer an easy way to preview the articles before deploying to production.

Given it's just me writing and no other content writers, I was happy to stick with a Git based workflow because it's super simple to just keep my Markdown blog articles where they were and I wouldn't be tied to any CMS provider because ultimately all the content still lives within my repo.

That really left me with two options

1. [Forestry](https://forestry.io/)
2. [Netlify CMS](https://www.netlifycms.org/)
