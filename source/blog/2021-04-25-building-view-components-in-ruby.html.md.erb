My site is styled using the wonderful [Terminal CSS](https://terminalcss.xyz/) which has multiple components included. One feature of Javascript frameworks that I like is this concept of components where the HTML, JavaScript and CSS live together rather than being spread about in different folders in the code base. The [ViewComponent](https://viewcomponent.org/) framework has more recently been introduced to Rails which achieves this and, along with things like [Hotwire](https://hotwire.dev/), are improving the front end experience for developers.
