This site is styled using the wonderful [Terminal CSS](https://terminalcss.xyz/) which has multiple components included. One feature of Javascript frameworks that I like is this concept of components where the HTML, JavaScript and CSS live together rather than being spread about in different folders in the code base. The [ViewComponent](https://viewcomponent.org/) framework has more recently been introduced to Rails which achieves this and, along with things like [Hotwire](https://hotwire.dev/), are improving the front end experience for developers.

View components are not something that exist for the Middleman static site generator but it's something I fancied trying to implement on my site which is built with Middleman. I wanted something that could be configured once and continue to work when adding new Ruby code, JavaScript and CSS.
