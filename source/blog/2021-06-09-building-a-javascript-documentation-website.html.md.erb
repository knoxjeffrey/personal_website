I think code documentation works best when it lives side by side with the code it is documenting rather than being written in a separate document. When it's separate, it becomes easy for documentation to become stale. Out of sight, out of mind!

However, documentation can be easier to read if it's nicely formatted rather than reading straight from the code editor. With this in mind, I started looking at [JSDoc](https://jsdoc.app/) for documenting my JavaScript code. You simply write the documentation with your source code and then run a command to generate a static website build with nicely formatted documentation.
