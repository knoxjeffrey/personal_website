This is a really short post to help show how the UIViewController Lifecycle works.

<!--more-->

I was initially going to write quite a detailed post on this but then I came across this post on [Stack Overflow](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/5562938/looking-to-understand-the-ios-uiviewcontroller-lifecycle) which I think expains it better with the use of an image:

<%= figure media: image_tag("lifecycle.png", alt: "UIViewController Lifecycle", class: "margin-bottom--m") %>

I found this to be a great reference, hope you find it useful as well.
