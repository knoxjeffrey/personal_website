I love the RESTful API generated automatically from my [Supabase](https://supabase.io/) PostgreSQL database by [PostgREST](https://postgrest.org/). However, at the beginning I did have concerns about how I could handle more complex queries ... that was at least until I read more about PostgreSQL Functions and how to build them in Supabase.

This is the [Netlify build data dashboard](https://www.jeffreyknox.dev/dashboard/) I was working towards building and I wanted to avoid introducing a calendar datepicker interface but rather only show the the years and months I had build data for. Below is a table representing my database columns

<% table caption: "Netlify build data table" do %>  
    <% table_head do %>
      <tr>
        <th>id</th>
        <th>deploy_id</th>
        <th>branch</th>
        <th>context</th>
        <th>deploy_time</th>
        <th>created_at</th>
      </tr>
    <% end %>
    
    <% table_body do %>
      <tr>
        <th>1</th>
        <td>xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx</td>
        <td>main</td>
        <td>production</td>
        <td>38</td>
        <td>2021-07-22T18:11:31.959+00:00</td>
      </tr>
    <% end %>
  <% end %>
